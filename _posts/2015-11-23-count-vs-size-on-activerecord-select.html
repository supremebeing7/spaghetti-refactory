I stumbled on this bit of weirdness when using the SQL query <code>User.select(:id, :name, :email).count</code>. It threw a <code>PG::UndefinedFunction</code> error. Using <code>User.select(:id, :name, :email).size</code> worked instead.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I did some digging. <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Calculations.html#method-i-count">According the the ActiveRecord docs</a>, <br /><blockquote>not all valid select expressions are valid count expressions. The <br />  specifics differ between databases. In invalid cases, an error from <br />  the database is thrown.</blockquote>I also stumbled on an issue on rails Github issues page about this, and a <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/19146#issuecomment-76599708">very helpful comment from rafaelfranca</a> explained that I can also use <code>count(:all)</code>.
