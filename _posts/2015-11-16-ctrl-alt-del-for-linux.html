Back in my Ubuntu days, I had some issues with my computer locking up, and I didn’t know Linux well enough to break free. Once I found out about this trick, I was able to unlock 90% of the time. <br /><br />The easiest way for me to remember was “BUSIER” spelled backwards. <br /><ol><li>Hold down the Alt and SysRq (Print Screen) keys</li><li>Type, the following, pausing one second between each - “R”, “E”, “I”, “S”, “U”, and “B”</li></ol>Follow the link if you want to know exactly what all these key presses are doing.<br /><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key#Commands">Magic SysRq Key | Wikipedia</a>
