Here’s a quick and nifty little trick that comes in extremely handy in a lot of situations, but particularly when dealing with an unfamiliar codebase, such as at a new job or working with a previously unused external gem.<br /><br />In the rails console, enter:<br /><pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs mel"><span class="hljs-keyword"><br /></span></code></pre><pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs mel"><span class="hljs-keyword">ls</span> Model </code></pre><br />and it will show all the class and instance methods, as well as associations and a bunch of other cool stuff for that model.<br /><br />I’ve begun using this in place of these two:<br /><pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs avrasm"><br /></code></pre><pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs avrasm">Model<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.methods</span><br />Model<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.new</span><span class="hljs-preprocessor">.methods</span></code></pre><br />Not only because it’s simpler with less typing but it else ends up being much easier to read.
