This is nothing that can't easily be found in the docs, but it was new to me:<br /><br />&nbsp;  <code>vagrant up</code><br /><br />This uses a Vagrantfile to start up a virtual machine (such as starting up an Ubuntu environment using VirtualBox)<br /><br />&nbsp;  <code>vagrant ssh</code><br /><br />This will SSH into the virtual machine, but first you need to ensure that SSH keys are configured properly. These can be passed in by setting this in the Vagrantfile:<br /><br />&nbsp; <code>config.ssh.forward_agent = true</code>
