Not all environment variable names are created equal.<br /><br />For example, if you are using Ruby on Rails, do not declare a <code>VERSION</code> environment variable, there is already one a reserved. The reserved <code>VERSION</code> envar is used by Rails in migrating database changes, so if it is changed at all, you will have problems when making new migrations.<br /><br />That was a fun error to debug...
