Say you want to display a list of all your users' names and link to their show pages. Instead of running <code>User.all</code>, instantiating every field of every user, there's a better way. Since you only need the name and id or slug (for the link), better to run:  <br /><br /><pre><code>@users = User.select(:name, :email)</code></pre><br />That will instantiate user objects with just those attributes, saving memory and database query time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, brand new for Rails 4.2, you can presumably print out the fields selected by called <code>@users.first.accessed_fields</code>. This is primarily helpful in development mode so you know which fields you have access to. However, I couldn't get this to work locally, might need to be using master branch of Rails.
