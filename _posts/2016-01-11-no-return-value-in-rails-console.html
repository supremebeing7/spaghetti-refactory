A quick tip when working in rails console. If you're testing commands to run and don't want the console to output the return value, just append a semicolon to your ruby code.<br /><code></code><br /><pre><code>  User.all<br />  # =&gt; [#&lt;user:0x007fd72a408630&gt; {:id =&gt; 1, :name =&gt; "Mr. T", ...}, tons and tons of other records]<br />  User.all;<br />  # =&gt; nothing!<br /></code></pre><br />OK, so that's a contrived example, but this really comes in handy<br /><br /><ul><li>when creating records, or&nbsp;</li><li>if you need to update several records in one shot and don't want to see the return values, or</li><li>POSTing to an external API and avoiding all the cruft that comes in the response</li></ul>
